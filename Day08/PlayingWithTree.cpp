/*
Description: In computer class, every student is somehow relative to each other. The teacher represents all students in the form of a binary search tree (BST).Every student has a  roll number as a random integer. In this binary search tree, the roll number of every student is a node of the binary search tree. He randomly picks up any two students from the class and names them as x and y, respectively. He asks students to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of x and y  in the BST.

The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes x and y as the lowest node in BST that has both x and y as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).‚Äù

Help students to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes, x and y.
