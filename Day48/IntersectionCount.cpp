Description: N friends are given tasks at various times, all have different efficiencies, 
so they finish the tasks at different times. To do the task all have to enter into a big room. 
The person who assigned the task will come once in a day to check and will report how 
many people were there in the room when he gave the task. Find what the person will report.
NOTEâ†’ Time is assumed to be an integer variable that takes the value 0 to 86400.
