/*
Description: Aliceâ€™s mom bought n bags of chocolates numbered from 1 to n. The ith bag (1 <= i<= n) has ai chocolates. Alice wants to share some of the chocolate bags with Bob such that both of them get an equal number of chocolates, but she is not able to divide them in such a way. Now, she wonders if it is even possible to do so. Help Alice find out if the bags can be divided between her and Bob such that both of them get an equal number of chocolates.
