Description: Ram was playing with an array when he got to know the existence of different patterns found in arrays. He wrote code for different kinds of patterns and enjoyed it a lot, one day he got stuck in a pattern and asked for your help.

He gave you an array letâ€™s call it arr and asked you to find the number of pairs of (i,j) such that given a number k :

0<=i<j<=arr.length - 1
arr[i] * arr[j] is divisible by k.
Given an array and a number k, find the number of pairs of elements in the array such that their product is divisible by k.
