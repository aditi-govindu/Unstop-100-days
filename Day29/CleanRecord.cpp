Description: The employees of a warehouse maintain a record of items that were brought in and taken out of it each day. The items taken out are represented as negative integers, and items brought in are represented as non-negative integers. The employees noticed that some of the entries in todayâ€™s record had been repeated by mistake.

The record has been given as a sorted linked list, and the employees ask for your help to get a new sorted linked list containing only the unique entries in it.
