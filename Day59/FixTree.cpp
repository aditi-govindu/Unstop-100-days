/* Description: Raj has a binary tree with n nodes numbered from 1 to n, which is rooted at 1. He wants to represent it on a chart paper using circular stickers as its nodes.He drew the binary treeâ€™s structure and bought n stickersto paste on it later, but while he was busy doing his homework, his little brother pasted them on the chart paper. Raj noticed that his brother had pasted more than one sticker on some of the nodes, and the rest were left empty.

Raj wants to fix this tree, but he can onlymake one of the following moves at once:

Move a sticker from its current node to its parent node (if any).
Move a sticker from its current node to one of its child nodes (if any).
Every time he moves a sticker, the glue on it becomes weaker. So, he wants to minimize the number of moves to make his chart more durable.

Help Raj find the minimum number of moves he needs to make such that each node has exactly one sticker representing it.
