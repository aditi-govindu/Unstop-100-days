Description: A lot of people in India hate rain, but you do not. Rain pacifies puts your thoughts in order. By these years, you have developed a good tradition â€” when it rains, you go on the street and stay silent for a moment, contemplate all around you, enjoy the freshness, think about big deeds you have to do. Today everything has changed quietly. You are a programmer such that whatever you find interesting, you would immediately convert it into a problem and try to get an algorithm for it. You saw water stagnation in front of your house after heavy rain. So, you got an idea to write a program to find the amount of water that stagnated.

You are given an iron bar which is of dimension 1 unit. Iron bars are placed in a particular format for each test case. You must display the maximum units of accumulation of water between the iron bars if rainfall has occurred in that building.
